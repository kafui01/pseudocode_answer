1.Why do programmers use pseudocode?
  Pseudocode offers a way for programmers to brainstorm how to
  develop algorithms before actually writing the it the particular
  language's syntax

2.If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
  Pseudocode is only meant for humans to read it will not run on a computer


              PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT
1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
   
   FUNCTION showGreaterNumber
     INPUT first number
     INPUT second number
     IF first number is greater than second number THEN 
        DISPLAY first number
     ELSE 
        DISPLAY second number
     ENDIF
   ENDFUNCTION

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

   FUNCTION printNumber
     INIT number
     FOR each number from 1 to 100
       DISPLAY number
       INCREMENT number
     ENDFOR
   ENDFUNCTION

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

   FUNCTION searchPhoneBook
     INIT number
     FOR each name in phonebook index
       IF name is equal to name in phonebook index
         DISPLAY name object
       ENDIF
       INCREMENT number
     ENDFOR
   ENDFUNCTION

4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, 
   implement it in any computer language of your choice.
     
          USING JAVASCRIPT

   phoneBook = [
             {name: 'kafui', number: 4405678333},       
             {name:'wisdom', number: 5439922245},
             {name:'priscilla', number: 5439758993},
             {name:'beatrice', number: 5439873245}
            ]

    function foo(name){
      for(let i = 0; i < phoneBook.length; i++){
        myname = phoneBook[i].name;
        if(name == myname){
          console.log(phoneBook[i])
        }  else {
         return null
        }
      }
    }

foo('kafui')
